            In a traditional military sense, it's when armies look to generate momentum after using the poor winter conditions to replenish.
            It is true that the fighting has become more static during typically cold conditions.
            However, all signs seem to be pointing towards an upcoming Russian push.
            Moscow has mobilised hundreds of thousands more men, as well as increased its production of weapons and ammunition.
            Kyiv is expecting to see major attacks from the east and south as soon as 24 February, which would mark a year since the full-scale invasion.

For now, Ukrainian troops are continuing to hold it.If or when the city falls, invading forces are expected to push towards the cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. It could allow Moscow to capture the entire eastern Donetsk region, one of its official goals.But that would involve capturing more than 4,000 square miles (10,360 sq km).
